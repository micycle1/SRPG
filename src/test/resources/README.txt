Test cases contain the vertices output from the original C project against a specific set of inputs.

Test case names refer to the following variables in this order:

N_x = 20;
N_y = 20;
mark_percent = 0.25;
holes = false;
aligned = false;
perturb = true;
smooth = 0;
hierarchy = 2;
diagonal = false;

The above would give "20,20,0.25,f,f,t,0,2,f.txt".
