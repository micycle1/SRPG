# SRPG â€“ Super Random Polygon Generator

SRPG generates simply-connected and multiply-connected polygons by means of a regular grid that consists of square cells.

Lots of parameters so capable of making:

* Random
* Octagonal
* Orthogonal 
* Smoothed
* Grid-aligned orthogonal

It is based on Martin Held's C implementation.
